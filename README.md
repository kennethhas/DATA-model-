# eMovies Streaming Remodel

The eMovies Streaming Remodel project is aimed at modernizing the movie rental model using a comprehensive data model that streamlines the process and enhances the user experience. This project features user authentication via phone number, regional restrictions, secure payment processing, and integration with the IMDB API for movie details retrieval.

## Project Overview

The objective of this project was to design a movie streaming rental service with the following features:

## Project Steps

1. **Planning Entities and Attributes**: The project started with the planning of entities, attributes, and their relationships on a textpad.

2. **Erwin CDM and LDM Implementation**: The planned data model was implemented using erwin's Conceptual Data Model (CDM) and Logical Data Model (LDM) views, using eMovies as a guide.

3. **Bridge Tables for PDM**: Bridge tables were created in the Physical Data Model (PDM) to manage many-to-many relationships.

4. **Formatting and Documentation**: The project was formatted, relationships were renamed, a README was created, and the project was uploaded to GitHub.
